## Hyperskill Solved Problems
Code challenges tackled during project development    
(LINK COMING SOON)

## Cinema Room Manager
A CL application that helps manage a cinema theatre: sell tickets, check available seats, see sales statistics, and more.

## Cinema Room REST Service (IN-PROGRESS)
In this project, you will create a simple Spring REST service that will help you manage a small movie theatre. Handle HTTP requests in controllers, create services and respond with JSON objects. Make good use of Spring and write a REST service that can show the available seats, sell and refund tickets, and display the statistics of your venue.
